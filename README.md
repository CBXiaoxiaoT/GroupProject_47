## BCS

The Multi-Tools project team recognizes that awareness of professional issues is an essential responsibility for software developers. Throughout the development process, we remained committed to ethical and professional practice by aligning with the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct. Below is a summary of how our project engages with the four ethical domains defined by BCS.

### 1. Public Interest (BCS Section 1)
- **User privacy**: All user data is stored locally; no server-side logging or cloud services are involved.  
- **Environmental responsibility**: The application avoids unnecessary background processes, thereby reducing energy consumption.  
- **Inclusive access**: Multi-Tools is released as a free and open-source application, enabling equitable access for individuals and organizations.  

### 2. Professional Competence and Integrity (BCS Section 2)
- Development stayed within our areas of technical competence and underwent iterative testing.  
- Unimplemented features (e.g., theme customization) are transparently documented in the issue tracker.  
- Only legally licensed and properly attributed open-source libraries are used, ensuring full compliance with software reuse standards.  

### 3. Duty to Relevant Authority (BCS Section 3)
- Although not under an external contract, roles and responsibilities were clearly defined and followed within the team.  
- No user data is shared, monetized, or repurposed outside its intended functionality.  

### 4. Duty to the Profession (BCS Section 4)
- Prepared for public open-source release, promoting transparency and professional collaboration.  
- Committed to future knowledge sharing through documentation and community engagement.  

### Remaining Gaps & Limitations
- **Accessibility and Inclusion (Section 1)**: No formal accessibility audit was conducted due to resource constraints. While the interface is clean and user-friendly, structured testing for users with visual, cognitive, or motor impairments is pending.  
- **Executable Distribution Verification (Section 4)**: The application is not digitally signed with a verified certificate, which may cause some antivirus software to flag the executable as unknown. Addressing this will enhance user trust and professional-grade distribution standards.

## Summary
Overall, the Multi-Tools project demonstrates strong alignment with the BCS Code of Conduct through responsible local data handling, legally compliant use of open-source libraries, transparent feature reporting, and a commitment to open-source collaboration. The identified gaps will guide priorities for future iterations and professional development.
